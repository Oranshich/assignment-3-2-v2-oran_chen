Info:
-----
This is the frontend of our Recipes website. It was designed and implemented to match the backend which was programmed in part 3.2 and based on the API we've created in swaggerhub for part 3.1.

We've created in advance two users, whom we've inserted to the database:
1. username: chen, password: 123456
2. username: oransh, password: Aa123456

Each of these users own 3 personal recipes and 3 family recipes.
